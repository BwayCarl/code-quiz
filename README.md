Bootcamp Assignment - Homework #4

Timed multiple-choice code quiz using JS. Responsive for small screens.

This assignment is still a work in progress and unfortunately has not been completed by
the due date. If time permits, I'll keep working on it before it is graded.

Functioning sections:
• Start page with instructions and a start button.
• Timer starts with first question.
• Score slightly different than assignment but functions:
    correct answer scores one point and adds 2 seconds to the timer. Incorrect answer subtracts 8 seconds form the timer.
• Final score is total correct answers plus time remaining on the clock.
• Game over when all questions are answered or when time runs out.

Non-functioning sections (work in progress):
• Currently unable to save score when prompted.
